        Head out to the LEND tab above. Pick an NFT you would like to lend. You
        will get a modal like this. Let&apos;s go through it together to
        understand what each piece of information here means.

          &nbsp;<b>NFT standard</b>. This is the NFT standard. There are 2 main
          standards out there: 721 and 1155. The 1155 standard lets you mint
          semi-fungible NFTs, which means that you have more than one NFT that
          looks the same, even though, they would have the same id. ReNFT
          protocol allows you to lend multiple amounts of this standard. But you
          need to understand a couple of things, before you lend such an NFT. We
          shall explain the nuances below.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          <img src="assets/faq/bullet-2.png" />
          &nbsp;<b>NFT address.</b> NFT address of the NFT you are about to
          lend.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          <img src="assets/faq/bullet-3.png" />
          &nbsp;<b>Token ID.</b> Token ID of the NFT you are about to lend.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          <img src="assets/faq/bullet-4.png" />
          &nbsp;<b>Available amount.</b> For 1155 standard, this number will
          tell you how many copies of this semi-fungible NFT you have. For 721s,
          this is always 1. This number tells you the maximum number of NFTs
          that you can lend.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          <img src="assets/faq/bullet-5.png" />
          &nbsp;<b>Lend amount.</b> In this example, we will only lend 2 copies.
          For 721s, you can not set this number, since there is only ever 1
          copy, so it will be disabled for you by default.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          <img src="assets/faq/bullet-6.png" />
          &nbsp;<b>Max lend duration.</b> It is imperative that you understand
          that this is the maximum number of days that your NFT can be rented
          out for by someone else. Therefore, be careful not to set it for too
          long, because if the floor price of the NFT rises, the renter may
          choose to not return the NFT. Think of lending as selling a call
          contract with a strike price of the collateral. If the floor price
          during the rent goes up to 2 ETH and you have set the collateral price
          at 1 ETH, then there is obviously a profit of 1 ETH for the renter.
          Therefore, it is important to actively monitor the market and update
          your lending when required. Another good way to manage this risk is to
          set a small max lend duration, such that it is less likely that the
          floor price goes up during the rent.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          <img src="assets/faq/bullet-7.png" />
          &nbsp;<b>Borrow price.</b> How much the renter will pay you per day
          for renting the NFT. The payments are accrued per second. If you
          return the NFT earlier, the correct amounts will be compensated back
          to you. Keep in mind, that when renter rents, they will pay both the
          full amount of rent, as well as collateral. This will go into the
          reNFT contract for escrow. In this example, the renter will have to
          pay 0.01 WETH per day to rent <b> ALL (2 copies)</b> of the NFTs we
          are lending here. Also note, due to the design of the contract, the
          numbers are limited to 4 decimal places for both the borrow price and
          the collateral. Also, note, that the whole number cannot exceed 4
          digits. This means that the max number is 9999.9999 and the min number
          is 0.0001.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          <img src="assets/faq/bullet-8.png" />
          &nbsp;<b>Collateral PER COPY</b>. Collateral if the standard is 1155.
          In this example, the collateral is 200 WETH. However, since the
          standard is 1155, the renter will pay 2 * 200 WETH. This is a crucial
          distinction versus 721. <b>KEEP THIS IN MIND</b> when lending the 1155
          standard!

        <div>
          <img src="assets/faq/bullet-9.png" />
          &nbsp;<b>Payment token</b>, we support WETH and a bunch of other
          stablecoins.

        <div>
          <img src="assets/faq/bullet-10.png" />
          &nbsp;<b>Action button.</b> If this is the first time you are lending
          a particular NFT, you will need to approve it. Only after approval,
          will you be able to lend it. So keep this in mind, you may need to
          issue two transactions on the first time around the NFT interacts with
          the ReNFT contract.

        &nbsp;<b>Rent amount.</b> For 1155 standard, this number will tell you
        how many copies of this semi-fungible NFT the lender is lending. The
        collateral you will pay will be multiplied by this number.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        <img src="assets/faq/bullet-5.png" />
        &nbsp;<b>Rent duration.</b> The length of the rent. If you fail to
        return the NFT by the end of this period, the lender will be able to
        claim the collateral you will pay.

      <br />
      <div>
        <img src="assets/faq/bullet-7.png" />
        &nbsp;<b>Collateral PER COPY</b>. Collateral price per NFT. If this is a
        721 standard, then this is a total collateral you have to pay. If this
        is 1155, then this is a per item collateral price. Note that you will
        have to pay full rent amount plus full collateral to rent. If you return
        earlier, the rent payment will be compensated proportionally. Collateral
        gets returned on successful return, as well.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        <img src="assets/faq/bullet-8.png" />
        &nbsp;<b>Total rent payable.</b> Depending on the standard and the
        number of days of the rent, this field will give you the total amount
        payable you will send to the reNFT contract for escrow.

      <br />
      <div>
        <img src="assets/faq/bullet-9.png" />
        &nbsp;<b>Action button.</b> If this is the first time you are renting,
        you will need to approve the payment token for reNFT. You will only need
        to do this once, per payment token. This button will change to Rent,
        once you have approved the payment token.
